Lego Mindstorms EV3-Robot

This is a school project. I have done all of the code myself, except the JavaFX UI.

This robot will travel around a set path until it finds an object (in this case, an object of the color red) using the camera.
The robot then picks up the object, returns it to the starting point and continues the path.
